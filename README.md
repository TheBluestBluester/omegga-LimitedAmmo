# omegga-LimitedAmmo
Make people care where they shoot.
This plugin gives players limited ammounts of ammo, ammo boxes and ammo dispencers.

## Creating ammo dispencers.
To create an ammo dispencer you first place a brick of your chouce. Then you add an interact component.

Then you write in "Print to console" the following:

ammodis (ammo box savefile name without .brs) (cooldown in seconds) (password)

If done correctly the ammo box of your choice should spawn ontop of the brick.
